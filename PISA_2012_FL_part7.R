# Unraveling a secret: Vietnam's outstanding performance on the PISA test 2012 following the Fryer & Levitt (2004) approach

# Prepared by Elisabeth Sedmik on Wednesday, June 24 2015
# Based on code by Suhas D. Parandekar

# Revised on 08/03/2015

# The following code tries to unravel the secret of Vietnam's outstanding performance on the PISA 2012 assessment. 
# It presents an analytical comparison of possible explanatory factors (as assessed within the PISA 2012 test) 
# of Vietnam's high test score in READ, comparing 7 other developing countries with Vietnam. The statistical 
# approach taken is a modified dummy variable approach following Fryer and Levitt (2004).

library(foreign)# To import and export data to and from R (eg. txt files)
library(xlsx)# To generate MS-Excel output
library(xtable)# To generate Latex output (in which the research paper is written)
library(epicalc)# For producing descriptives of data
library(tables) # Computes and displays complex tables of summary statistics

############### 5. REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR READ OF A MODIFIED FRYER & LEVITT (2004) APPROACH ################

################################## 5.1 Introduction & baseline regressions ##################################

# The Main idea is quite simple: We build a regression on PISA test scores of 1) a dummy representing Vietnam 
# (which we already created) and 2) a vector of other covariates (which we will create in this section). 
# We start with the dummy variable as the only regressor. Covariates are added to the regression subsequently. 
# In each turn, we analyze how and with which specific addition the (Vietnam) dummy variable decreases/becomes 
# insignificant in association with the test scores.

############# 5.2 Explanatory variables - Students, teachers, pedagogical practices and schools #############

# Useful tip: Take a moment and think about the specific regressors you want to choose (eg. Teaching variables,
# Student Attitutde, Parent Involvement, etc.) that best fit with your conjecture. Since our target is to 'unravel
# a secret', namely why Vietnam did so well in PISA 2012, it requires quite a rigorous and holistic approach, so
# we analyze many potential sources.

# Please see our conceptual scheme. We have arranged possible explanatory variables into four sets of factors and
# working through the codebooks, questionnaires and Technical Manual, carefully decided which variables (or indices)
# to use to proxy these factors: 

# NON ROTATED PART

# 1. Students
# Background: FEMALE, ST05Q01, REPEAT (indexed ST07), ST08Q01, ST09Q01, ST115Q01, MISCED, HISEI,

# Home Support: SC25 (Parent Participation, SC), SC24Q01 (Parental Expectations, SC)
# Gender Balance: PCGIRLS (Proportion of girls enrolled at school, SC)

# 2. Teachers
# Quantity: STRATIO, PROPCERT, PROPQUAL, TCSHORT
# Quality: TCFOCST, SC30Q01, SC30Q02, SC30Q03, SC30Q04, SC31Q01-Q07 (TCH incentive), SC39Q08

########################## 5.2.1 Explanatory Variables - rotated & non-rotated questions #######################

# The student questionnaires administered to students contains a common part and three rotated sections (two of
# which were given to each student). For example, Student Ann would answer the common part, rotation question set 1
# and rotation question set 2, Student Bert would answer the common part, rotation question set 3 and question set 1
# and so on, so that all rotation parts are answered by 2/3 of the sampled students. 
# For more details please read: PISA 2012 technical report, p. 58-61 and p. 376-386

# The school questionnaire administered to school administration does not contain rotated parts. 

# We follow our conceptual scheme, ie first student variables, then teacher variables, and so on; we will first look at the 
# questions in the non-rotated parts (ie. questions that were administered to all students) and the school questionnaire.
# In a later step we will look at the rotated questions. 

############################### 5.2.2 Non-rotated Questions - Student variables #############################

# As we regress on the independent variables from the questionnaires (eg. hours spent learning outside school, etc.), we 
# need to first make sure that we are not faced with too many missing cases per independent variable; otherwise we cannot
# analyze it. We therefore create intermediary files with the specific variables, see how many cases are missing, drop
# the missing cases and add it back to the main file. In the process we will loose quite a few cases and our sensitivity
# analysis later on will work in a reverse order of dropping missing variables to ensure that our findings are coherent.
# For an overview of how to handle missing data in R we recommend: http://www.statmethods.net/input/missingdata.html

# How big is our initital sample size? Two ways to check: 
T0 <- DEVCON8a[, c("VIETNAM")] 
N0<- NROW(na.omit(T0))
N0 # 48483 data points

# Let's get started with the non-rotated student variables:

# How many non-missing values for all non-rotated student variables (excl SC25)?
T1b <- DEVCON8a[, c("VIETNAM","ST04Q01","ST05Q01","REPEAT","ST08Q01","ST09Q01","ST115Q01","MISCED", "HISEI",

N1 <- NROW(na.omit(T1b)) 
N1 # 35345
N0-N1 # 13138 NAs

# And now we are completing the missing cases, to work on a dataframe of non-missing variabels for these regressors
