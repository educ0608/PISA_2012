# Unraveling a secret: Vietnam's outstanding performance on the PISA test 2012 following the Fryer & Levitt (2004) approach

# Prepared by Elisabeth Sedmik on Wednesday, June 24 2015
# Based on code by Suhas D. Parandekar

# Revised on 07/21/2015

# The following code tries to unravel the secret of Vietnam's outstanding performance on the PISA 2012 assessment. 
# It presents an analytical comparison of possible explanatory factors (as assessed within the PISA 2012 test) 
# of Vietnam's high test score in MATH, comparing 7 other developing countries with Vietnam. The statistical 
# approach taken is a modified dummy variable approach following Fryer and Levitt (2004).

# Outline:
# 1. GENERATING DATA SET (MERGING, CLEANING) 
# 2. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WITH VIETNAM + 7 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
# 3. PISA SCORES
# 4. REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR MATH OF A MODIFIED FRYER & LEVITT (2004) APPROACH (in part 2)
##################################################################################

# Loading R packages to process PISA data:

# Admin packages
library(foreign)# To import and export data to and from R (eg. txt files)
library(xlsx)# To generate MS-Excel output
library(xtable)# To generate Latex output (in which the research paper is written)
library(epicalc)# For producing descriptives of data
library(tables) # Computes and displays complex tables of summary statistics
library(stargazer)# For latex regression and summary statistics tables

# Modeling packages
library(intsvy)# For PISA (and TIMSS, PIRLS, etc) analysis with Plausible Values (PV) and Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR)
library(TDMR)# For tuned data mining in R - eg. detect column of constants in dataframe
library(gmodels)# For model fitting, contains various R programming tools (eg. PROC FREQ like tables)
library(dplyr)# For varioys data manipulation
library(psych)# For rescaling variables to given mean and sd
library(sm)# for locally smoothed regressions and density estimation
library(lme4)# To run mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4

# Please be aware that many packages (eg. tables, intsvy) require additional packages to run. When trying to load
# the package, R will tell you which ones are missing. Overall you may need to download around 40 packages.

# We generate new, merged data sets based on the student data set and school data set for the 8 countries
# that have a Per Capita GDP below $10,000 in PPP for 2010, based on OECD-PISA Table Table IV.3.2 
# OECD-PISA Report: "PISA 2012 Results: What Makes a School Successful?" (Volume IV, Chapter 3, Table IV.3.2)

# Please refer to the questionnaires, codebooks and the technical manual (pages 396-398) about the specific
# variables included in the data files and their abbreviations  
# for an overview of included variables see: http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012technicalreport.htm
# and for abbreviations see the student and school codebooks: http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php

# We will filter for the 8 developing countries per country by school id and merge into one file ("DEVCON8"):

# Albania 

ALB_T <- filter(student.rda, cnt == "ALB") # filter by "cnt" and create a new student file just for 'Albania'
ALB_S <- filter(school.rda, cnt == "ALB") # filter by "cnt" and create a new school file just for 'Albania'
ALB_P <- merge(ALB_T, ALB_S, by = "schoolid") # merge both files into one file just for 'Albania'
ALB_P$cnt <- ALB_P$cnt.x # we duplicate "cnt.x" as "cnt" (it is only called "cnt.x" since we merged ALB_S and ALB_T, not that in ALB_S and ALB_T it was called "cnt")
ALB_P$cnt.x <- NULL # we delete the column "cnt.x"
ALB_P$subnatio <- ALB_P$subnatio.x # we duplicate "subnatio.x" as "subnatio" (to have the same nomenclature as in the original data!)

# We want to have a unique identifier number per student per school per country. Note, that for all countries, numbering of school and student id's
# starts at 1; so we introduce "NEWID" to create for a cumulative list spanning all 8 countries:

ALB_P$COUNTRY <- 1 # We numerate each country alphabetically, starting with Albania = 1, Colombia = 2, etc.
ALB_P$NEWID <- (ALB_P$COUNTRY*10000000)+((as.numeric(ALB_P$schoolid))*10000)+(as.numeric(ALB_P$stidstd))

# Useful tip: these are very large data files. to double check if the new columns have been created, do not load 
# the new file ALB_P into the editor window, as it will only show up until a certain column or take very long to load. 
# Instead, type in "ALB_P" into the Console to see all columns (and the first 10 rows per column). 

# Now we repeat the same process for the remaining 7 countries:

# Colombia

###################### 2. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WITH VIETNAM + 7 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ######################

# We generate Kernel plots (comparison of non-parametric univariate density estimates) for Math, Science and Reading scores 
# comparing Vietnam to the group of 7 developing countries as identified above and the OECD Average. 

# The 'sm' package (used for locally smoothed density estimates) requires that country names are converted into factors, 
# (ie categorical variables) so we create a new column (VNM.f), which contains either 'Vietnam' or 'Group of 7' as a factor. 
# Useful resource on the use of factors in R: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html

DEVCON8$VNM.f <- factor(DEVCON8$VIETNAM, levels=c(0,1),labels = c("GROUP OF 7", "Vietnam"))

# For the Kernel plots we are using the 'sm.density.compare' function of the 'sm' package, because it allows
# to superimpose the kernel density plots of two or more groups; in our case 'Vietnam' and 'Group of 7'

# Two important points:

# 1. You will notice that from now on, that we will frequently use 'W_FSTUWT'. It stands for the
# final student weight (ie. size of the student body in the respective country), that needs to be applied 
# to the PVs (Plausible Values) to correctly compute the PISA score.
# The methodology can be found here: http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012technicalreport.htm (Chapter 8)

# 2. For the numeric vector (PV3MATH) we randomly pick one of the 5 PVs for the Math Score,
# since we are 'smoothing' the values anyway (through Kernel). Plausible values are intermediate values
# provided to obtain consistent estimates of population parameters. Ideally, we would analyse all five PV's, 
# average the result and significance tests adjusting for variation between the five sets of results computed. 
# However, for the purpose of producing descriptive statistics, we deem our approach sufficient. 
# You can double check with different PV's and will notice only slight differences.
# Please refer to the PISA 2012 technical report (cited above) page 147. 

# Note: if 'weights' is used, the number of bins must be set to 0 ('nbins=0') 
# Note: we select bandwith as h=35. There are different approaches to selecting bandwith and you can adjust 'h' to see
# which bin size you prefer to best visualize the density plots.

############################################## 3. PISA SCORES  ##############################################

# The most important tip from now on: work closely with the PISA 2012 technical manual AND get familiar with
# functions of the 'intsvy' package (which does all the rigorous calculations of PISA PV's etc. for you!)

# To highlight this, look how the intsvy packages helps you find the Mean PISA Scores for Vietnam from the PVs:

meanMATH <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel="MATH",by="VIETNAM", data=DEVCON8, weight="W_FSTUWT")
meanMATH
meanSCIE <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel="SCIE",by="VIETNAM", data=DEVCON8, weight="W_FSTUWT")
meanSCIE
meanREAD <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel="READ",by="VIETNAM", data=DEVCON8, weight="W_FSTUWT")
meanREAD

# Similarly, you can find the mean Math scores for all 8 countries through sorting by "COUNTRY" 
# (remember we assigned countries numerical values from 1 to 8 alphabetically)

meanCNT <- pisa.mean.pv(pvlabel="MATH", by="CNT", data=DEVCON8, weight="W_FSTUWT")

# R-squared      19.61       1.81   10.85

# The difference between mean score values is the coefficient value on the dummy. For example, the intercept (383.29) +
# VIETNAM (128.05) = 511.34: the mean Math Score for Vietnam.
