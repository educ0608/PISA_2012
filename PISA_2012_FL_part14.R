# Unraveling a secret: Vietnam's outstanding performance on the PISA test 2012 following the Fryer & Levitt (2004) approach

# Prepared by Elisabeth Sedmik on Wednesday, June 24 2015
# Based on code by Suhas D. Parandekar

# Revised on 08/05/2015

# The following code tries to unravel the secret of Vietnam's outstanding performance on the PISA 2012 assessment. 
# It presents an analytical comparison of possible explanatory factors (as assessed within the PISA 2012 test) 
# of Vietnam's high test score in SCIE, comparing 7 other developing countries with Vietnam. The statistical 
# approach taken is a modified dummy variable approach following Fryer and Levitt (2004).

# Loading R packages to process PISA data:

# Admin packages
library(foreign)# To import and export data to and from R (eg. txt files)
library(xlsx)# To generate MS-Excel output
library(xtable)# To generate Latex output (in which the research paper is written)
library(epicalc)# For producing descriptives of data
library(tables) # Computes and displays complex tables of summary statistics
library(stargazer)# For latex regression and summary statistics tables

# Modeling packages
library(intsvy)# For PISA (and TIMSS, PIRLS, etc) analysis with Plausible Values (PV) and Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR)
library(TDMR)# For tuned data mining in R - eg. detect column of constants in dataframe
library(gmodels)# For model fitting, contains various R programming tools (eg. PROC FREQ like tables)
library(dplyr)# For varioys data manipulation
library(psych)# For rescaling variables to given mean and sd
library(sm)# for locally smoothed regressions and density estimation
library(lme4)# To run mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4

# Please be aware that many packages (eg. tables, intsvy) require additional packages to run. When trying to load
# the package, R will tell you which ones are missing. Overall you may need to download around 40 packages.
